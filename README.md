# aes128_image_encryption

Using Altera Quartus Prime and a Nios II Processor, encrypt an image for Electronic CodeBook (ECB) and Cipher Blocker Chaining (CBC).

Switch on the FPGA board should have separate functions on the live camera feed such as pause/unpause and displaying a menu.

Image should be transferred to AES-128, encrypted on the plaintext with output displayed, and also repeated for ECB and CBC.
